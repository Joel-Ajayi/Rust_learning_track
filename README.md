# Rust Learning Project

This repository contains my learning journey through [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), also known as "The Book".

## Project Structure

The `examples` directory contains various code examples demonstrating Rust concepts:

- `generic.rs`: Examples of generic types, traits, and implementations including:
  - Generic functions with trait bounds
  - Custom traits (A, B, C)
  - Vector operations with generics
  - Implementation of zip function for vectors

## Topics Covered

- Generic Types
- Traits and Trait Bounds
- Collections (Vec)
- I/O with command line and file handling
- Ownership and Borrowing
- Error Handling (Option, Result)
- Smart Pointer (Option, Result)

## Running Examples

To run any example file:

```bash
cargo run --example <filename>
```

For instance:

```bash
cargo run --example generic
```
